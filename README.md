# Airline-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer reviews and feedback on social media to identify common complaints and improve the airline's customer service. The system is built using machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
# Tools and Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn library
NLTK library
# Data Collection
The dataset of customer feedback is collected from various sources and consolidated into a single database.
The dataset includes attributes such as customer feedback text, sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), and date of feedback.
# Data Preprocessing
The customer feedback text is preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
The NLTK library is used for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
# Feature Engineering
The customer feedback text is converted into numerical features using techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and bag-of-words.
Features such as sentiment polarity, word count, and sentiment scores are also extracted from the feedback text.
# Machine Learning
The preprocessed and feature-engineered data is split into training and testing sets.
Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and random forest classifiers are trained on the training data.
The accuracy of each model is evaluated on the testing data using various performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
The best performing model is selected for deployment.
# Results
The deployed model is used to classify new customer feedback and identify common themes and issues.
The analysis can help the airline company to identify areas for improvement in their services and address customer complaints in a timely and effective manner.
# Conclusion
The use of machine learning and NLP techniques in analyzing customer feedback can help airline companies improve their customer service and enhance customer satisfaction.
